# 'Programming Collective Intelligence' in Haskell (PCIHaskell)

I'm currently reading through the '[Programming Collective Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596529325?ie=UTF8&tag=giusjour-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596529325)' book, and since I'm currently learning Haskell I thought it would be a nice exercise to implement the presented algorithms in Haskell.
