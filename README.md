# 'Programming Collective Intelligence' in Haskell (PCIHaskell)

While reading through the '[Programming Collective Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596529325?ie=UTF8&tag=giusjour-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596529325)' book, I thought that it would be a nice exercise to implement the presented algorithms in the book in Haskell, since I'm currently learning the language. 

This is my very first project written in Haskell, and since I'm quite the Haskell novice, it's very likely that you'll find the one or other line of code that is in need of improvement. If you have any feedback regarding the code, I'd be more than thankful if you'd [send me an email](http://giu.me/contact) regarding this; I'm always open to improvement suggestions and/or critics.
